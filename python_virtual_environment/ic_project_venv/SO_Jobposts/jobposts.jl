Well, we know everyone has their favourite language or framework, but we also know that it\u2019s important to use the right tool/language/framework for the job at hand, and that a pragmatic approach might mean using a language that is already in production. Also, polyglot developers tend to focus on core software engineering principles and practices, rather than what is shiny in a new framework or language.

Studios like Warner Bros. are replacing their million-dollar home-grown solutions and spreadsheets with our Saas offering. </p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer at Qwire, you will be a part of a cross functional team developing a full stack JavaScript application.  Our technical stack includes Node.js powering our REST APIs and services, along with Postgresql, Redis, and ElasticSearch deployed on AWS.   On the front end, we use React, Redux, and Thunks.  At Qwire, we write our own tests as developers. We use Jest as our testing framework, and maintain unit, API integration, and end-to-end tests using Cypress.io.</p><p>You should have depth and experience across some meaningful subset of our stack.

We place more emphasis on you telling us a bit about yourself, why you're a good fit for this project, and your relevant experience. A couple of paragraphs in the \"About You\" section will do. That should give us enough context to review your GitHub profile, open-source contributions, and/or other code you've written, which we've found is the best way identify potential team members.  Please include a link to your personal website, repo, or other online code you've written that we can have a look at.  </p><p>Every candidate that submits an application will get a response. We'll reach out to selected candidates to schedule an initial call after reviewing each submission.
